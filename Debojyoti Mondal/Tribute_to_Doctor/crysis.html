        Major Crisis in India</h1>

    <h2 align="center"><u>Oxygen Crisis</u></h2>
    <p align="center">The problem was noted during the peak of the first wave in September 2020, and recurred on
        a
        much
        larger scale during the peak of the second wave, in April and May 2021. Some trackers have estimated
        that as many as 512 lives were lost across the country due to oxygen shortage or denial.The
        reason is not a lack of medical oxygen, per se, but the inadequacy of the distribution network of
        tankers to transport liquid oxygen from the point of manufacture, to the hospitals.This entire supply chain was
        severely disrupted at multiple levels due to the steep and sudden rise in demand across the country—from 3,842
        MT per day on 12 April 2021 to 8,400 MT per day by 25 April, and further up to 11,000 MT per day by the
        beginning of May—before gradually reducing as the number of fresh cases declined.

    <h2 align="center"><u>Shortage of Hospital Beds</u></h2>
    <p align="center">The second wave of the pandemic has once again exposed the inadequacy and unpreparedness of
        India’s
        healthcare infrastructure to deal with pandemics. India had just about 7,13,986 hospital beds across
        25,778 hospitals in the government sector before the pandemic began, the health and family welfare
        ministry estimates.

    <h2 align="center"><u>Economic crisis</u></h2>
    <p align="center">The Indian economy had already been showing signs of distress much before the arrival of the pandemic. Any attempts of reviving the economy have only become more difficult as the effects of a lockdown have intensified the downward pressures on the economy. In simplistic terms, the national income of a country is determined by private and government consumption expenditure, investments and net exports
