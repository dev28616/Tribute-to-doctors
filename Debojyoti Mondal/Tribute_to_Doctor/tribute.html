        <h2><u>Struggling Overnight</u></h2>
        <p class="paragraph"><span>Personal</span> protective equipment is special equipment you wear to create a barrier between you and germs. This
            barrier reduces the chance of touching, being exposed to, and spreading germs.The most common problems
            associated with using PPE kits was excessive sweating (100%), fogging of goggles, spectacles, or face
            shields (88%), suffocation (83%), breathlessness (61%), fatigue (75%), headache due to prolonged use (28%),
            and pressure marks on the skin at one or more areas on repeated use (19%). Occasional problems reported were
            skin allergy/dermatitis caused by the synthetic material of the PPE kit, face shield impinging onto the neck
            during intubation, and nasal pain, pain at the root of the pinna, and slipperiness of shoe covers. Various
            ways and means have been employed by the HCWs to actively address and solve these problems</p>

        <h2><u>Comes Under Depression</u></h2>
        <p class="paragraph"><span>The</span> results of 422 responses revealed a 63.5% and 45% prevalence of symptoms of depression and stress,
            respectively, among frontline COVID-19 doctors. Postgraduate trainees constituted the majority (45.5%) of
            the respondents. Moderately severe and severe depression was noted in 14.2% and 3.8% of the doctors,
            respectively. Moderate and severe stress was noted in 37.4% and 7.6% of participants, respectively.
            Multivariate regression analysis showed working ≥ 6 hours/day to be a significant risk factor for moderate
            or severe perceived stress, while single relationship
            status and working ≥ 6 hours/day significantly contributed to the development of moderate,
            moderately severe, or severe depression.</p>

        <h2><u>Doctors are Real Heroes</u></h2>
        <p class="paragraph"><span>The</span> current pandemic that the world is undergoing warrants that this is perhaps the most difficult time we
            are ever going to face in our lives. It is even more difficult for the doctors who are working tirelessly to
            ensure that all those that are infected are provided with proper medical facilities. Their contributions and
            hard work deserve our gratitude each and every day.The year 2020-21 belongs to doctors and the healthcare
            workers who are risking their lives to fight the lethal, invisible virus Covid-19. While India stays at home
            to curb the spread of the pandemic; armed with masks, gloves, and protective gears, the medical community is
            working tirelessly round the clock amid mounting pressure, fear of being infected, and harassment and
            discrimination.</p>
